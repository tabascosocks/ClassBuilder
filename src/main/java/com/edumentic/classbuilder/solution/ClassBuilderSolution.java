/**
 * The {@code ClassBuilderSolution} describes the overall planning solution for the student-class allocation problem
 * using OptaPlanner. It defines the key domain objects and how OptaPlanner should treat them during optimization.
 *
 * <p>
 *    This solution consists of:
 *    <ul>
 *       <li>A {@code List<StudentClassAssignment>} which represents the planning entitiesâ€”each item is an individual student assignment to a class.
 *           These must be pre-populated at the start, with typically one assignment per student.</li>
 *       <li>A {@code List<StudentClass>} which holds all the available classes that students could be assigned to.
 *           This collection acts as a value range for class assignment, and should include enough classes to cover the minimum required per optimization rules.</li>
 *       <li>A {@code HardSoftScore} which is computed as the solution score, reflecting adherence to hard constraints (must haves)
 *           and soft constraints (nice-to-haves/custom preferences).</li>
 *    </ul>
 * </p>
 *
 * <h3>OptaPlanner Annotations:</h3>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link PlanningSolution}: Marks this class as the solution model recognized by OptaPlanner.</li>
 *   <li>{@link PlanningEntityCollectionProperty}: Denotes the collection of planning entities for OptaPlanner to change during solving.</li>
 *   <li>{@link ValueRangeProvider}: Makes the available classes a selectable range for entity assignment.</li>
 *   <li>{@link ProblemFactCollectionProperty}: Marks available classes as problem facts, which stay constant during solving.</li>
 *   <li>{@link PlanningScore}: Indicates the final solution score.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>To use this class, populate {@code solutionAssignments} (one per student) and {@code availableStudentClasses} prior to solving.
 * OptaPlanner will assign each student to a class, attempting to optimize according to domain constraints/rules.</p>
